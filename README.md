# Health Services Research Datasets
This GitHub repository contains links and (some) data files for public datasets relevant to health services research.

The repository is maintained by Nate Apathy (nate.apathy@gmail.com, www.nateapathy.com) and is not directed towards any particular domain or topic area of health services research. Rather, this is intended as a location to store quick reference materials for the many data sets relevant to health services research that, at times, can be difficult to track.

Each sub-directory contains a single data set with a text file documenting the location of the data and what kinds of variables are included in the dataset. For some, I have also included a list of relevant topics of study for which that dataset may be useful. Eventually, once this becomes large enough, I will likely include a table of contents along with links to other data respositories.

Finally, here are some dataset lists that are useful for getting started:

1. [NBER Data Sets](http://www.nber.org/data/)
2. [CDC Data Sets](https://www.cdc.gov/DataStatistics/)
3. [CDC Survey Data Sets](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/surveys.htm)
4. [CDC BRFSS](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/index.html)
5. [Public Health Systems Data Sets List](http://www.publichealthsystems.org/articles/data-and-methods/datasets)
